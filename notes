join table recipe_ingredients

join table



Your application should use a join table called "recipe_ingredients" to keep track of the ingredients for each recipe.

Build your site so that it passes the tests in spec/features. There aren't tests for index pages or things like page headers or links, but feel free to add these (otherwise your app will be difficult to navigate).


NOTE: Each test has a helpful comment above it!

HINT: If you give a checkbox <input> a name attribute like ninja_turtle_colors[], each ninja turtle color will be passed to the params hash in an array: { ninja_turtle_colors: ["red", "blue", "orange", "purple"] }.

BONUSES!
Keep track of the quantity of ingredients currently on hand. Display on each recipe page how many dishes can be made given the existing ingredients.

Write RSpec unit tests to verify your ingredients-to-dishes calculator.
