**Goals**
1. keep track of the quantity of each ingredient

2. recipes#show display how many dishes can be made given existing ingredients

**Tasks**

1. add quantity column to ingredients table
  (how involved does this have to be? does it have to be x cups?)

2. based on available ingredients, calculate how many dishes of a recipe can be made

3. write unit tests (which maybe is the first task)
